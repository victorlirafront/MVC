In Go, **modules** are the way to manage dependencies and versioning for your Go projects. A module is essentially a collection of related Go packages stored in a specific directory. 

### Key Concepts of Go Modules

1. **Definition**:  
   A Go module is defined by a file named `go.mod` in the root of the directory. This file contains metadata about the module, including its name, dependencies, and their versions.

2. **Module Path**:  
   The module's path is typically the repository URL (e.g., `github.com/user/project`), which helps Go locate the module when importing it.

3. **Dependencies**:  
   Modules specify their dependencies in `go.mod`, and Go automatically manages their versions using a file named `go.sum` for checksum validation.

4. **Versioning**:  
   Modules follow **semantic versioning** (e.g., `v1.2.3`) to ensure compatibility and clear communication about changes.

5. **Commands**:  
   - `go mod init`: Initializes a new module and creates a `go.mod` file.  
   - `go get`: Adds or updates dependencies in the module.  
   - `go mod tidy`: Cleans up unused dependencies.  

6. **Advantages of Modules**:
   - Eliminates dependency on the GOPATH directory.
   - Simplifies version management.
   - Provides reproducible builds.

### Example:
```bash
# Initialize a module
go mod init github.com/username/project

# Add a dependency
go get github.com/gorilla/mux

# Tidy up dependencies
go mod tidy
```

### Files Created:
- `go.mod`: Defines the module and its dependencies.
- `go.sum`: Tracks the checksums of the module's dependencies for verification. 

Modules are essential for modern Go development and have been the default dependency management system since Go 1.13.
